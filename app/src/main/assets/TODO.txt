---- This is used to keep track of as of yet incomplete game functions ----

UX:
-Update notification icon
-Persist sound throughout all activities/get new loop for each activity
-Make inventory item selection more intuitive -> whip up a dialogue
!!!!!!-Figure out how services work and make sure these are killed with the process

GAMPLAY:

MECHANICS:
-Figure out some rational pricing for weapons
-Tweak drop rates for normal monsters
-More intelligent monster scaling/step amount calculation
!-Load in single list of all monsters + bosses, sort by steps
!-Split list into as many sub-lists as there are challenge ratings
!-Set everything in each list to the newly distributed duration based on the challenge rating
!-randomize monster from probability distribution around player level, more likely for CR closer
    to the player's level
!-generate bosses as a distribution starting at like 3-5 higher than player level
!-scale village events based on CR for player level minus a couple
-Stats actually affect stuff:
--Str: Blade multiplier
--Dex: Bow multiplier/available boost speeds
--Con: Blunt multiplier/available boost times
--Int: Wand multiplier
--Wis: Exp multiplier
--Chr: Lower shop prices
--Put this information in dialogues that pop up when you click a stat
