---- This is used to keep track of as of yet incomplete game functions ----

UX:
-Update blunt weapon/notification icons
-Sound effects for menu buttons and fragment sliding
-less unsatisfying fragment transition animation
-persist sound throughout all activities/get new loop for each activity
-Make inventory item selection more intuitive
-Figure out some rational pricing for weapons
-Evenly space out items in the shop
!!!!!!-Figure out how services work and make sure this one is killed with the process

GAMPLAY:
-Implement system for boosts that can be bought in the shop
-Give boosts an actual price
-Come up with some way to display possible boosts/what boosts there are
-Adventure Log
--List of events that have taken place
--Stats like #monsters killed, #steps walked, etc.

MECHANICS:
-Tweak drop rates for normal monsters
-More intelligent monster scaling/step amount calculation
!-Load in single list of all monsters + bosses, sort by steps
!-Split list into as many sub-lists as there are challenge ratings
!-Set everything in each list to the newly distributed duration based on the challenge rating
!-randomize monster from probability distribution around player level, more likely for CR closer
    to the player's level
!-generate bosses as a distribution starting at like 3-5 higher than player level
!-scale village events based on cr for player level minus a couple
